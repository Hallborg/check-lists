## Check list for writing integration tests ##

- Unit tests should already be in place
- You probably have an idea of how the units should interact.
  Write as much as you can into tests.

# Mock all dependencies that should not be a part of the integration tests.

# Single concept for each test.

# Make it readable by extracting private functions.

# Minimize the number of tests. Do you have anything that is already
  covered in unit tests?
